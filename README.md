# MultiClass_SVDD
Multiclass classification using Support Vector Data Description (SVDD).

Matlab code.

A multiclass classification based on SVDD is presented in this MATLAB script. The code is a first attempt to describe and adapt to Matlab the useful but complicated problem of multiclass SVDD. The code is nonetheless functional and suitable for theoretical testing, with the intention of making it perform well in strongly applied cases.
NClass_SVDD_exe.m is the example code of the multiclass SVDD, while NC_SVDD_TRAINING.m and NC_SVDD_TEST.m are the training and testing functions of the model respectively. 
Other functions have been included to allow the program to function properly.
